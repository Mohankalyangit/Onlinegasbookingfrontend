                    <h2>Welcome To IndianGas Pvt. Ltd.</h2>
                   IndianOil has played a major role in India’s transition to cleaner fuels from the time it started marketing Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) in 1965. Brand Indane was conceived in 1964 to bring modern cooking to Indian kitchens and the first Indane LPG connection was released on 22nd October 1965 at Kolkata. From a humble beginning of a consumer base of around 2,000 in 1965, the brand has grown into a super brand that rules nearly 16 crore kitchens. As a matter of fact, every second cooking gas connection in India is an Indane.

Indane has now become one of the largest packed-LPG brands in the world with IndianOil as the second largest marketer of LPG globally. Indane is a Consumer Superbrand as conferred by the Superbrands Council of India. It is a brand synonymous with safety, reliability, and convenience.

Today, Indane LPG is sold and delivered in six different pack sizes. The 5kg and 14.2 kg cylinders are largely meant for domestic use and comprise almost half of all gas distributed while the 19kg, 47.5 kg and 425 kg Jumbo cylinders are marketed for industrial and commercial consumption. The recently launched 5 kg and 10 kg cylinders made of fiber composite with a trendy and translucent look are the latest addition in the domestic category. Indane LPG is also supplied in bulk to large volume consumers in the manufacturing and engineering sectors.

To improve LPG penetration in the country and help better the lives of rural masses, IndianOil undertook the task of achieving 100% LPG penetration in the country in December 2015. Vyachakurahalli in Chikkaballapur district in Karnataka became the country’s first smokeless village, entering into the Limca Book of Records-2017, after all households switched from conventional fuel to LPG.

At IndianOil, we continuously strive for customer delight through our value-added products and services. Indane has leveraged the strength of digital technology to provide numerous initiatives for greater customer convenience viz.
